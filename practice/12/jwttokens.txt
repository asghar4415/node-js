JWT Tokens are used to authenticate users and are generated by the server. 
The server generates a token and sends it to the client. The client then sends the token to the server with each request. The server verifies the token and allows the user to access the resources. The token contains information about the user and the permissions they have. It is signed by the server to prevent tampering. The token is usually stored in a cookie or local storage on the client side. It is important to keep the token secure and not expose it to others. If the token is compromised, the user's account could be at risk.
